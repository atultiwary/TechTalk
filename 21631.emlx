1. introduction 
a. talk goal: your development in ruby, javascript, and SQL, and implementation into various projects
b. introduce what you're going to talk about (each section of the talk)
2. background
a. What skills did you have in programming before coming to animoto?
3. Steps and learnings
a. What did you do to learn ruby (books you read, websites you used)
b. same with SQL, javascript
c. review the differences from what you're used to, and the challenges you came across
4. Projects that you worked on
a. analytics dash: rewritten from a scripty-style to an OOP style that is much more performant
b. SQL queries that you had to work on for people and some of the insights they raised
c. Statty2 bugs: fixing the widget view so the rollup field doesn't reset. making sure a "commercial" rollup included custom post rolls
5. ec2 project
a. integration into statty2: ec2 metrics of both sum(render_length) and the compute per length (CHECK OUT THE NEWEST QUERY ON MASTER/STABLE AS IT HAS SLIGHTLY CHANGED, WE CAN GO OVER WHY IT IS THAT WAY AND YOU CAN TALK ABOUT WHY IT MAKES MORE SENSE)
b. autolaunch mongo data (maybe good to go over how the query got rewritten a few times and the reasons why it was updated, good example of code iteration and code review)
6. insights/learnings/wrapup
a. relatively freeform, show off the ec2 metrics included in statty2, etc, open up for questions


let me know if you have any questions, and feel free to play around with the format as you wish--this is your presentation, not mine ;)
